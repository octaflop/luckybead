At Lucky Bead Consulting, we understand that the rapid pace of new technology
is difficult to keep up with, but we also know that an effective implementation
of new technologies can bring great rewards to those who risk such an
endeavour. 

We exist to take on these endeavours with you. With our experience and
knowledge of new technologies and their implementation, we will take your
small to medium-sized business or organization into the next decade of online
technology.

More information about our pricing and services can be found on the
[services](/services/) page of our website.

## Current Associates

Lucky Bead Consulting contracts information workers from around the world in
order to effectively solve your problem. We focus on contracting local,
Canadian individuals, but we may contract our work to non-Canadians as well if
necessary.
