So I'm writing this on a bumpy 80' bus bouncing along Hastings Street in
Vancouver, typing away at the latest updates to some client code, when I
realize that I'm kind of living my dream right now! Ever since our family had a
computer, I always found some excuse or another to tinker around with it.
Admitidly, a large portion of that time centered around gaming, but in those
first encounters there were also gaps of boredom.

<!-- more -->

I can speak volumes about boredom, but I won't for obvious reasons. Focusing on
the various remedies I procured for boredom, now that's an interesting matter
(pardon my tautologies). Our family had one Windows computer for the longest
time, and that used to be the only world of computing I knew. I slowly became a
Windows 2000 power-user, but I always felt like something was missing. For
example, my friends at school used to show me some QBasic code they hacked
together in-between classes. But I couldn't get QBasic to run on Windows 2000,
so I went on to other things. My first semester in High School, I coded a
Visual Basic portfolio application and programmed all of my coursework into it.
I finished that class in 2 weeks, but still had to fill another 7 weeks. So I
kept coding. What I wanted to build was a music player app. I never finished
it, but I learned two things about Microsoft, coding, and computing in general:
Visual Basic (and .NET) are **toxic**. VB is a temptress who forces you to click
through monolithic paradigms with business and enterprise focus (also see:
Powerpoint). Secondly, in a institutionalized school environment (or any
organization which has reached a level of growth without a testing/experimental
cycle), arguments of security almost always beat out arguments of convenience.

But now students are forced to circumvent protocols or give up trying. I never
finished that app because WindowsNT -- for all of its access control and client
provisioning, locked out normal users from all development libraries. Visual
Basic was running on a “jailed” directory and I couldn't make any apps with
media, networking, or even mouse inputs (other than buttons). 

Fast-forward 10 years and with my present knowledge I still feel disgusted
knowing how much time, money, and man-power was wasted on a stupid
anti-feature in the guise of "security". Fun fact: the school's mainframes were
hacked two years prior by, “some French guy”.

## Always on the Go

Since I started university in 2006, I have always favoured the laptop over the
desktop computer. And I have continusely pushed the portability of my laptop to
its limits. 

## Today I Stab at Thee!

10 years.

10 years of poking at keys, cursing at monitors, and solemnly retiring
technology. 10 years and at least 8 attempts at coding websites, blogs,
ecommerce apis, templates, and web-camera control software. 

With the exception of the proprietary shopping cart app I had to incorporate
with Intuit accounting software, I have exclusively used open source
development software.
